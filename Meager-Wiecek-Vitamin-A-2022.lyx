\begin_layout Abstract
Vitamin A supplementation is considered one of the most effective interventions to reduce child mortality in developing nations. However, its estimated effect varies substantially across studies, making the results of meta-analyses in this literature highly sensitive to methodological choices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
We compare the theoretical properties and empirical performance of classical fixed-effects and random-effects meta-analysis models on simulated bodies of evidence. We consider Bayesian implementation using a hierarchical model. We find that using random effects either matches or substantially outperforms the fixed effects method in terms of mean squared error and is robust to misspecification of the likelihood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Applied to a set of 17 studies, a Bayesian model estimates that vitamin A supplementation reduces mortality risk by 26% (95% interval 42% to 12%), compared to 12% under the fixed-effects model (95% interval 7% to 17%). The underlying heterogeneity across studies is large, with 83% of the cross-study variation attributable to genuine differences in treatment effects, but this is not precisely estimated. Fixed effects thus underestimate both the reduction in mortality and the uncertainty surrounding the general effect of supplementation.

Public health researchers and international aid organisations consider vitamin A supplementation one of the most important and cost-effective interventions to reduce child mortality (Imbdad et al 2011, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation 2011). UNICEF refers to vitamin A programming as a

\end_inset

 for achieving Millenium Development Goal 4, the goal of child survival, particularly in countries with high vitamin A deficiency rates (UNICEF, 2007). The potential of large-scale vitamin A supplementation to effectively reduce child mortality was first established in Sommer et al (1986) using a randomized controlled trial in Sumatra, Indonesia; the program reduced child mortality by 34% of base risk. The literature that followed displayed substantial variation in results across different contexts, but often confirmed or strengthened the initial finding (see for example Vijayaraghavan et al 1990, Rahmathullah et al 1990, Herrera et al 1992, Arthur et al 1992, VAST 1993).

% - biological underpinnings 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

The biological mechanism by which vitamin A affects mortality is relatively well understood: retinoic acid has a specific role in visual system function and in the immune system where it improves T and B cell gut-homing capacity and enhances T cell proliferation (Mora et al, 2008 and Iwata et al 2004). This explains why vitamin A deficiency is often associated with greater mortality risk in longitudinal data (Sommer et al, 1983). While the effect of supplementation in the absence of vitamin A deficiency is unclear, this deficiency is prevalent in so many developing countries that the World Health Organisation recommends general supplementation (WHO, 2016). A meta-analysis performed in 2011 concludes that the average risk ratio of supplementation is 0.76 and thus recommends universal supplementation (Mayo-Wilson et al 2011, Imbdad et al 2011).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

But more recent results from the largest ever randomised controlled trial (RCT) of vitamin A supplementation threaten to overturn this consensus (Awasthi et al, 2013). The study, performed in India, reported only a small and statistically insignificant reduction in child mortality (Awasthi et al, 2013). This was not the first time a study had found no effect of vitamin A, and one previous study even found a slight and insignificant increase in mortality (Herrera et al, 1996). But Awasthi et al (2013), often called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

DEVTA trial
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, studied millions of subjects and produced the most precise estimate of the risk ratio ever recorded. However, despite this impressive precision, the DEVTA trial was unusual in many ways: in particular, it had a different delivery mechanism and a lower rate of compliance relative to other studies (Awasthi et al 2013, Sommer et al 2013). As a result, some researchers remain unconvinced that the DEVTA trial should meaningfully overturn or alter the conclusions of the previous three decades of research on Vitamin A (Sommer et al, 2013, and Garner et al, 2013).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

Faced with severe disagreements in the scientific community about the implications of a body of research, the methodological question of how to aggregate and interpret the evidence from seemingly-contradictory studies becomes crucially important. This question has material consequences for science and policy, because the conclusions of evidence aggregation exercises are often sensitive to the statistical methodologies chosen in these contexts. Both Imbdad et al (2011) and Awasthi et al (2013) fit a fixed-effects meta-analysis model and found a risk ratio of 0.89, a difference of more than ten percentage points from the previous meta-analysis (Mayo-Wilson et al 2011). But Sommer et al (2013) note the heterogeneity in the results and suggest that a random effects aggregation model would produce more reliable results. In the economics literature, terms

Earlier work by Hedges and Vevea (1998), Overton (1998), and Field (2001) reported simulation studies assuming that either the functional form of the FE model or the RE model was exactly correct, used non-Bayesian RE methods which are known to have problems (see Cornell et al 2014, Brockwell and Gordon 2001), and scored performance by type 1 error rate. By contrast, we examine performance on a wider range of data-generating processes for which neither meta-analytic model is correct, including distributions with fat tails and multi-modal mixture distributions. We evaluate performance by conducting a Monte Carlo simulation and measuring the mean squared error (MSE) of the two procedures for estimating the average treatment effect, rather than hypothesis test error rates. We do this because research communities are increasingly interested in getting an estimate as close as possible to the true effect size, not simply testing for the existence of a non-zero effect (Wasserstein and Lazar 2016).

The canonical fixed-effects meta-analysis model uses an inverse-variance weighted average of the studies' estimated effects to produce an estimate of a general or typical treatment effect (Higgins and Green, 2011, 9.4.3). For a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 studies with estimated treatment effects and reported standard errors 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\hat{\tau}_k, se_k\}_{k=1}^K$
\end_inset

, the FE estimator is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\label{fe_tau}
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\tau}_{FE} = \sum_{k=1}^K \hat{\tau}_k \frac{  (se^2_k)^{-1}   }{  \sum_{k=1}^K  (se^2_k)^{-1}  } \; \; .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end_inset

The standard error of this estimate is calculated as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\label{fe_se}
\begin{aligned}
\hat{se}_{FE} = \sqrt{ \frac{ 1  }{  \sum_{k=1}^K  (se^2_k)^{-1}  }} \; \; .

If the studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\tau}_k$
\end_inset

 is asymptotically normally distributed, then this method is optimal in the class of estimators produced by linear combinations of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\hat{\tau}_k\}_{k=1}^K$
\end_inset

. This result is proved in Hedges and Vevea (1998) but had been established informally in the statistics literature years prior. We review it here: formally, assume that the point estimators are consistent and that each study has enough data and the empirical distributions have enough regularity such that, for all

 metric (i.e. 
\begin_inset Formula $I^2 = 1- \omega(\tau_k)$

Bayesian approach to meta-analysis also allows for straightforward calculation of posterior predictive distribution (p.p.d.) of the effect. Generically, p.p.d. tells the researcher what values the unobserved data could assume, conditional on observed data. In the case of meta-analysis, where we are interested in true treatment effects, this refers to prediction of the effect in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

one additional study
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau'$
\end_inset

, and therefore generalizability of intervention. Under the FE model p.p.d. is trivially equal to the distribution of mean treatment effect (since they are shared by each study). In other words, all of uncertainty in p.p.d. is uncertainty in estimate of common effect. Under the RE model, variance is a sum of this uncertainty and heterogeneity (

).

Using p.p.d's calculated under Bayesian implementation of FE and RE models offers researchers a possibility to compare the two models. We follow Gelman et al.

This is done by excluding one study at the time, refitting the model to remaining studies, and calculating predictive performance in terms of expected log predictive density (elpd).

 This problem does not imply that we should use the FE model instead, since if the underlying effects are heterogeneous then the FE estimator is also inefficient. Nor can we rely on popular tests of homogeneity in effects, as they typically have insufficient power to detect heterogeneity (Field, 2001). In practice, particularly for experiments performed in the field across different countries, researchers are often unwilling to rule out heterogeneity completely yet unhappy to draw inferences that are based on a potentially misleading specification of that heterogeneity. The relevant question then is which of the two meta-analytic approaches is likely to perform better in the presence of heterogeneity under a variety of conditions, and in particular, when the RE model misspecifies the distribution of treatment effects across studies.

%WW: old text (repeat of what was in the intro, hence removed) Previous studies of meta-analytic methodology have not examined the performance of Bayesian hierarchical models, instead focusing on other implementations; in addition, they have not studied cases where both estimators are substantially incorrect such when the true effect distribution across sites is fat tailed or otherwise subject to outliers (Field 2001, Hedges and Vevea 1998). We perform a Monte Carlo simulation study of bodies of evidence similar to the vitamin A literature in order to investigate this relative performance even in these adverse cases. We consider the mean squared error of the estimation of $
\backslash
tau$ as the performance metric, rather than type 1 error as has been used in previous literatures, since researchers are interested in getting an estimate as close as possible to the true effect size, not simply testing for the existence of a non-zero effect (Wasserstein and Lazar 2016).

Statistical models rarely describe the true generating process of any data set. In most cases neither the RE nor FE estimator will be exactly optimal for a meta-analytic problem. But one procedure could still outperform the other in certain conditions, and their relative performance in various settings should inform the choice of estimator. In this section we use the Monte Carlo method examine relative performance of RE and FE models on a variety of data-generating proccesses (DGPs).

We begin by generating data from the RE model with Gaussian distribution of true effects, at different values of standard errors and cross-study variations. We then gradually move away from this model by examining Student-t distributions of effects, then adding location outliers, and finally adding outliers in the standard error distribution as well. Further details of the DGPs are in Appendix B. For each DGP we run a total of

We make no adjustment to the BHM in any of the simulations.

However, these priors are so diffuse that this should not meaningfully impede the Bayesian model's performance (and nor do they).

The MSE for FE and RE (BHM) models is then calculated as the mean over 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 simulations. We summarize the results by looking at ratios of MSEs in FE and RE model. The full results are shown in the Appendix and summarized in graphs that follow. First, consider the normal-normal model as data-generating process (DGP), in which both the estimators and true effects are normally distributed. In this case the BHM has the correct functional form. Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "simulation_results_sigma_vs_se"

 shows the ratio of the FE MSE to BHM MSE for 16 simulations, varying the average standard errors of the point estimates and the average standard deviation of the true effects (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

). Darker red values indicate a higher ratio, which means the FE MSE is much higher than the BHM MSE, an indicator of poor relative performance of the FE model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that RE model performs better than FE for the normal-normal DGP. A reasonable complaint about the exercise above is that the BHM's superior performance was potentially due to the correct functional form specification. Therefore we now consider deviations from the normal-normal DGP. Overall the BHM still out-performs the FE estimator on average despite the functional form misspecification.

The two methods perform similarly well when the point estimates have standard errors in the range [5,20]: the ratio of MSEs lies between 0.99 and 1.1 in this area, representing at most a 1% improvement from using the FE estimator which occurs when the standard deviation of effects 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 lies in [0,5]. When 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 lies in [5,20], we can achieve 10% improvement in MSE from using the BHM. However, when the standard errors lie in the range [0,5] the BHM is twice as efficient when 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is also in this range, and up to four times as efficient when 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is in [15,20]. This means that in these squares of the grid, the FE estimator has an increase in MSE of 300% relative to the BHM. By contrast, in any given square of the grid the BHM has at most a 1% increase in MSE relative to the FE when it is beaten by the FE method, which only occurs when 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is very low.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may seem surprising that the BHM obtains a much lower MSE than the FE Estimator in the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 lies in [0,5], which includes the case of no underlying heterogeneity. However, recall that the BHM nests the case of no heterogeneity: the model is perfectly capable of estimating 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^2_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 to be essentially zero and then effectively implementing the FE model. The BHM uses up a degree of freedom to perform this estimation, but its overall performance is still close to that of the FE estimator in this case. Of course, as shown in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table:simulations"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 in the Appendix, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\tau} = 0$
\end_inset

 the FE estimator does have a lower MSE than the BHM estimator: it must do, because correctly setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^2_{\tau} = 0$
\end_inset

 ex-ante is more efficient than estimating it to be 0. However the improvement is small in most of these simulations, and the largest relative improvement (a reduction by half) occurs when there is very little sampling error at all, so in practice this translates to very small absolute improvements. By contrast, the BHM can achieve major reductions in MSE when 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is in the range 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,5]$
\end_inset

, so overall it has less than half the MSE of the FE on average in the range 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,5]$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A reasonable complaint about the exercise above is that the BHM's superior performance was potentially due to the correct functional form specification. Therefore we now consider deviations from the normal-normal DGP. First, we examine the case where the true effects are Student t distributed across sites with considerably heavy tails, although the sampling uncertainty is still Gaussian. Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "student_t_mse"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows the results for a student t with 3 degrees of freedom, which has extremely fat tails relative to the normal (in fact the kurtosis is infinite).
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed


\begin_layout Standard
The infinite kurtosis makes the simulations unstable. We tested several seeds and did not find major qualitative differences in the ratio of MSEs, although the raw MSEs did take different values even with large numbers of simulations.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The FE estimator now performs slightly less poorly in the area where the standard errors are in the range [0,5], although it still has double or triple the MSE of the BHM in this area. When the standard errors are in the range [5,20] the FE estimator can now attain up to a 10% reduction in MSE relative to the BHM in some areas of the grid, but the BHM still attains a 10% reduction in other areas. Overall the BHM still out-performs the FE estimator on average despite the functional form misspecification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now consider an alternative specification error in which the underlying data-generating process is a mixture distribution with potentially multiple modes. We first use a mixture distribution to create a classical outlier problem, which occurs when one site's true effect takes a value very different from the rest of the sites' true effects. However, in meta-analysis there is another potential type of outlier: one site may have a standard error that is very much smaller or larger than the rest of the sites' standard errors. We refer to this second type of outlier using the terminology 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

precision outliers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, to distinguish from the more classical 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

location outliers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

. To my knowledge this paper constitutes the first attempt to formalize this problem, although meta-analytic issues created by differential precision have been noted in Higgins and Green (2011). We examine both types of outliers separately in the following simulations.

\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

. The results look quite similar to the normal- normal DGP results, with only slightly worse performance from the FE estimator in the upper left quadrant.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "precision_outliers_mse"

caps "false"

\end_inset

 shows the ratio of FE MSE to BHM MSE when the normal- normal DGP model has one site in which the standard error is ten times smaller than the rest of the sites' standard errors on average. This makes a substantial difference in the relative performance of the FE estimator - it has double or triple the MSE of the BHM estimator in most of the grid area. In the worst case scenario for the FE it has MSE almost 6 times the size of the BHM estimator's MSE. In the worst case scenario for the BHM estimator, it still has roughly the same MSE as the FE estimator. Thus, in cases where one site is much more precise than all the others and there is no reason to believe effects are homogeneous, the BHM strongly outperforms the FE estimator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why does the fixed effects method perform so poorly in this case? While precision is unequivocally a good thing in a single study, it can be problematic in meta-analysis because precision and generalizability are two distinct but related properties. An estimate can be precise - and thus contain a lot of information about the site it comes from - without containing 
\emph on
generalizable
\emph default
 information. In these simulations, the size of the effect which was much more precise was the same as the other effect sizes on average. All the site effects were a-priori equally generalizible, and ex-post equally likely to be good indicators of the general effect 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

. But the highly precise effect was treated as more generalizable by the FE estimation process because this method has no way to distinguish precision and generalizability: indeed, if all effects are the same then precision actually is a perfect indicator of generalizability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By contrast, random effects methods can and must distinguish these two concepts because they must handle the possibility of heterogeneous effects. The BHM uses the concept of a parent distribution, and specifically the functional form of the parent distribution, to place each effect in context of the other effects. In the real world, the precision outlier is likely to be even more misleading for the FE estimator because that site's effect size is probably qualitatively different to the other sites. A study that is ten times more precise than all other studies may have a larger sample size because it is easier to collect data there, or it is more attractive to governments or NGOs to fund big studies there - these factors are probably correlated to the study's true effect size in some way. Thus, the relative reduction in MSE gained by using RE models in the presence of precision outliers is likely to be even greater than the results of these simulations suggest.

Fixed-effects and random-effects models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previous theoretical analysis and simulation studies suggest that a random effects analysis using a Bayesian hierarchical model is typically a more appropriate choice of methodology for aggregating evidence relative to the FE model. While the FE estimator can beat the BHM when heterogeneity is small relative to sampling error, it rarely achieves a major reduction in MSE in the simulation study presented here. By contrast when the BHM beats the FE model it routinely achieves an MSE half as large, and in some cases can achieve an MSE less than 1/5th the size of its competitor's MSE. This is a very favourable efficiency versus robustness tradeoff, giving a strong argument to consider the RE model implemented via BHM as default choice for meta-analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vitamin A literature is particularly suited to aggregation using RE because there is scientific and statistical evidence that underlying effects are heterogeneous across contexts and that this heterogeneity is likely large relative to the sampling error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vitamin A studies we consider here differ in important ways, spanning several different countries, time periods, implementation and distribution methods and base rates of vitamin A deficiency in the populations studied. Because supplementation has only theoretically-grounded medical benefits for individuals with vitamin A deficiencies, the rate of deficiency in the population is likely to have major impact on the observed effect of supplementation on the population's risk ratio.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also statistical evidence for heterogeneity, primarily that the 95% confidence intervals for the risk ratios do not overlap in many of the studies. Both the DEVTA (2013) study's interval and the Herrera (1992) interval do not overlap with both the Rahmathullah (1990) interval and the Arthur (1992) interval. Indeed, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^2$
\end_inset

 test results presented in Webtable 3 of Awasthi et al (2013) show strong evidence of heterogeneity: the authors do not discuss these results, but the low p-values in this context are indicative of heterogeneity (Cochrane Handbook Section 9.5.2). Moreover, the DEVTA study (Awasthi et al 2013) is almost an order of magnitude more precise than the other studies in the literature. This study is a precision outlier, and as we saw in the simulations, it is preferable to use an RE model in such a case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of the above suggests that BHM is appropriate methodology to aggregate the evidence on the effect of Vitamin A supplements on all-cause child mortality. We therefore fit both FE and RE models using Bayesian inference, which in turns allows us to compare them in terms of expected log predictive density.

%This object only takes values on $R^+$ and thus cannot be modeled as normally distributed, but can be modeled as lognormally distributed around the true relative risk statistic with some sampling variation. Indeed, working with the RR on the log scale is considered the most suitable methodology in medical statistics according to Altman et al (1986) and  Gardner and Altman (1986, p750). Thus, Awasthi et al (2013) transform everything to the log scale to perform their meta-analysis, as shown in Webtable 3 of the supplementary appendix. In keeping with this approach, we use the following likelihood model for the Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis:

For the BHM of all studies we find the mean RR is 0.74 (95% interval from 0.58 to 0.88), compared to 0.88 under FE model (95% interval from 0.83 to 0.93), which is similar to the value reported by Mayo-Wilson et al. The effect under RE model is more diffuse than under the FE model, but both models suggest that (in the analysed sample of studies) vitamin A supplements have on average considerably reduced child mortality. The FE method gives a higher and more precise estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $RR$
\end_inset

 because it does not take into account the heterogeneity across sites.

Examining the posteriors for individual studies (Figure

) shows that the effects are heterogeneous. This can also be seen based on summary statistics for the model: the average pooling factor is 0.17, suggesting that 83% of the observed variation in estimated treatment effects is due to genuine differences between effects across studies. However, heterogeneity is not precisely estimated, something that is typical to many meta-analyses of that size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This heterogeneity is also reflected in the posterior predictive distribution of risk ratios for the RE model. It has a mean of 0.77, with 95% interval ranging from 0.4 to 1.3. (For the FE model it is by definition the same as the average effect.) This indicates that while we can be confident in the vitamin A effects within the analysed sample of studies, posterior predictive probability of RR being below 1 is 88%.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Standard
We note that due to assumed normality of distribution of true effects the upper end of the distribution has a somewhat nonsensical interpretation: for example, the model implies a 2.5% change of 30% increase in the risk of mortality in a new study. Since we know that vitamin A supplementation is safe, a more appropriate model could consider a non-symmetrical distribution, with more probability mass concentrated around no effect rather than a harmful effect. Note, however, that this consideration is relevant for decision makers who are risk averse. In our case we focus on behaviour of the mean effect and do not consider the decision problem.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Uncovering substantial heterogeneity prompts the question of why the impact is different across settings. In principle this question can be answered using contextual variables that describe differences in both the study designs and local contexts. In the vitamin A literature, there is presumably substantial variation in baseline vitamin A deficiency and the public health infrastructure that supports the intervention. The design of the trials also varies, particularly in the delivery mechanism which was direct in most cases but done via regional health centers in Awasthi et al (2013), leading to lower compliance with the supplement regime. Additionally, only some of the trials were double-blinded, and the intensity of the monitoring of outcomes per child differed dramatically across studies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, the original papers do not report sufficient information to permit the construction of quantitative variables suitable for statistical analysis. For example, many studies did not collect data on the control group rates of vitamin A deficiency, since observing cases of xerophthalmia and nightblindness in the children of the communities being studied is indicative of a severe enough deficiency to plausibly justify intervention. This rationale makes sense within each individual study, but has lead to a situation in which it is now impossible to determine how much heterogeneity is due to characteristics of studied populations versus study design. This serves as a reminder that collecting data on contextual variables in field trials is important for the scientific process.

Robustness to exclusion of DEVTA trial

The debate over the design of the DEVTA trial and the resulting difference in compliance rates relative to other studies has lead some researchers to suggest that it should not be included in meta-analyses. Sommer, West and Martorell (2013) dispute Awasthi et al.'s (2013) claims about the effectiveness of the DEVTA trial's supplement delivery mechanism and patient compliance, finally commenting

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

Overall, the normal distribution of true effects seems to fit vitamin A studies we analysed very well and no single study appears pivotal to the result. The general pattern indicates that the typical effect should be somewhere in the region of RR=0.75, but the posterior predictive distribution of future impacts is not highly concentrated around this point, due to the heterogeneity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The DEVTA result is a precision outlier, a type of result which, as we have shown in our simulations, may have a detrimental effect on the performance of the FE estimator in presence of heterogeneity. Precision outliers do not heavily impede the performance of BHMs because they are designed to detect heterogeneity and reweight the evidence accordingly. It is not the case that highly precise studies are

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in any given method. Rather, when true treatment effect are heterogeneous any single estimate should not heavily influence the general estimate no matter how precise it is. While high precision indicates high information about the site 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 in which the effect was estimated, this site is still just a singular data point in the set of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 data points. High precision does not necessarily indicate highly generalizable information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Formal model selection using cross validation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While our simulations and the high estimated heterogeneity are perhaps sufficient justification to choose an RE model over an FE alternative, we can also quantify the differences between the models by using a LOO CV approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For models without DEVTA trial, the performance of RE and FE models is comparable, with a slight preference for RE model (RE elpd of -13.8, compared to FE elpd of -14.0).
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed


\begin_layout Standard
In this case, i.e. when DEVTA trial is excluded, the choice between FE and RE models in this purely data-driven way is difficult. While the elpd value is not interpretable, both models are evenly matched in terms of number of studies for which they offer a better out-of-sample prediction (eight studies each).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 When DEVTA trial is included, RE model still performs similarly (elpd of -14.1) but the FE model cannot fit data anymore (elpd of -35.9). In summary, the LOO CV procedure justifies choice of an RE model regardless of whether the DEVTA trial is included in the set of meta-analysed studies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The controversy in the vitamin A literature arose in part because of disagreements over the validity of using FE to aggregate the evidence, and the suitability of the RE alternative in this setting. Although Awasthi et al (2013) argued that RE models

\end_layout

\end_inset

give undue weight to small trials,
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
"
\end_layout

\end_inset

 the analysis presented in this paper shows that there are strong theoretical and empirical reasons to prefer the RE approach. While FE models are optimal under homogeneous treatment effects, RE models are optimal when the effects have underlying heterogeneity. When neither model describes the true data-generating structure, Monte Carlo simulation results show that the Bayesian hierarchical model either matches or outperforms the FE estimator by a wide margin in terms of MSE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the same input data as the meta-analysis by Mayo-Wilson et al. (2011), a BHM estimates a typical reduction in the risk of child deaths of 26%. We detected substantial heterogeneity in treatment effects, with 83% of the observed variation attributed to genuine underlying differences across sites, although heterogeneity is not precisely estimated. The BHM results are robust to the inclusion or exclusion of the DEVTA study: despite its precision, it is only one study in a heterogeneous literature. Without DEVTA, the risk reduction is 29%. Fundamentally, in the presence of heterogeneous treatment effects, precision in estimating average effect is not a sign of generalizability. Because the FE estimator cannot distinguish these two concepts, it underestimates the reduction in mortality risk, and is overly precise. This is in keeping with previous work showing the FE estimator typically overstates the precision of meta-analysis findings (Schmidt, Oh and Hayes, 2011) and thus the RE estimator is generally preferable when seeking to generalize beyond the set of studies in hand (Borenstein et al, 2010).

This analysis also confirms the advantages of the Bayesian approach to meta-analysis (Smith, Spiegelhalter, and Thomas, 1995).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The evidence shows that the general impact of vitamin A supplements on all-cause child mortality is substantial. However, it also suggests important differences in treatment effects across studies, and caution should be used before extrapolating from the studies in this literature into new settings. Given the biological mechanisms, vitamin A supplements should have a much larger effect on mortality when the population has a high rate of severe vitamin A deficiency, and this alone could account for the observed heterogeneity. However, study design could play an equally important role, given the major differences in delivery mechanism, compliance and monitoring across studies. Future work could explore the sources of this cross-site heterogeneity, and thus improve the effectiveness of the supplements in low-impact settings or target supplement programs more effectively to areas that need them most.

# vitamin-a

This is code and paper repository for the work-in-progress paper on vitamin A supplementation and child mortality.

The paper is in the main folder

Code structure is very simple, there are three parts:

1. `simulation` (outputs in `simulation_results/`): simulations comparing performance of FE and RE models; this is not yet fully clean yet, but the code should run stand-alone in R
2. `meta-analysis`: the main script that replicates all analysis is `fit_ma.R`
3. `paper`: this has scripts used to generate tables, figures and some text (not fully cleaned yet)
